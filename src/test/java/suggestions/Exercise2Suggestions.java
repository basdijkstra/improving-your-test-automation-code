    // Suggestion 1: That's a pretty messy test... Locators, test data and element interactions all in the same place.
    // What would your advice be here?

    // Suggestion 2: Let's move implementation details for the different pages and elements to their own classes.
    // That promotes readability and maintainability.

    // Suggestion 3: Take a look at the page classes in pages.exercises. Maybe you can use these instead?

    // Suggestion 4: And then what about those sendKeys(), click() and getElementText() helper methods?
    // We still need them in all of our page classes... And that's duplication.
    // Isn't there a better solution for that?

    // Suggestion 1: That JSON payload looks very similar in all three tests.
    // Maybe there's a better way to create it?

    // Suggestion 2: Creating request payloads like this isn't very flexible and requires
    // quite a bit of maintenance (especially when it gets bigger). Maybe there's a better way?

    // Suggestion 3: It's not just the payloads that look similar, the three tests do the exact same
    // thing, just with different amounts for the loan amount and for the expected result. There might
    // be a better way to do this, right?
